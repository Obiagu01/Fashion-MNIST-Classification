# Fashion-MNIST-Classification
Using Keras and classes in Python , develop a CNN with six layers to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset fashion_mnist.py
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with six layers to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset using Keras is created. 
The model will include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers, with appropriate preprocessing and training steps
The model will train on the Fashion MNIST dataset and print the test accuracy and loss after training
To make predictions for at least two images from the Fashion MNIST dataset
The previous code is modified to include predictions for at least two images from the Fashion MNIST test set, displaying the predicted class labels and their corresponding class names
